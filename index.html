						What a fool I have been…..creating sadness, when I 	should have been spreading joy for you!
						I don't really deserve your forgiveness….maybe just your pity.
						What can I do….if anything to lighten your heart?
						Is there anything I can do, to help you build trust in me again, someday?

						I remain hopeful for a reply.

					<p class="gallery" id="gallTwo">
						A miracle of love, is precisely what we have been given.  Spending time with you…..Any amount of time…..is like flying thru the ocean breezes above. Come share my life….. with Me…..and true love is what we will see.	I love and care for you more than anything or anyone in my life! We can make beautiful moments, n memories together. My commitments in life will be to bring you joy and laughter.
						<br>
						I adore you!
						<br>
						What say you?

						Dear………
						<br>
						There are times in all our lives where we need to make changes. Where we must take a separate journey than the one we are presently on. Our time together, is etched on my heart and will always remain. Forgive me now, for I am walking toward a new horizon.      Please allow yourself the freedom to realize we must part, I only hope that your new journey brings you happiness and peace.
						<br>Most sincerely,
						<br>……………………
